### Hi!  ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my repo that I use for self development and learning! It is full of concepts and practices from: nano second performance Order matching (Stock Exchange) with Java concurrency and beautiful D3 charts to Codility challenges and AWS serverless lambda applications.

As said, this is just a learning repo, so you will find a lot of missing things (e.g. no javadoc, no tests, etc.). I simply want to learn and try out new stuff here!
